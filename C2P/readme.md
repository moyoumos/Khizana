**C2** programmer for **C8051** and **EFM8** devices from Silabs, using Arduino as probe.

this programmer is a work-in-progress enhanced version of https://github.com/x893/C2.Flash .

**to add new chip:** copy-paste and modify a line in *DeviceList.txt* file according to new chip.

I successfully programmed the following devices with this setup:

-EFM8LB12

-EFM8UB31
